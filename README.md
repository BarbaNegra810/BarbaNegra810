Hello, my nickname is Barba , and I am a software developer with over 30 years of experience.

I began my career as a Delphi developer in 1993. Since then, I have worked with various languages and technologies, including Oracle PL/SQL, Perl, Clipper, and Java.

Currently, I am updating my skills to include Python, JavaScript, and other modern languages. I am always seeking new ways to learn and grow as a developer.

I am constantly looking for new challenges and opportunities. I am interested in working on projects that have a positive impact on the world.
